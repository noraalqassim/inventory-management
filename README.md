# Inventory Management

In this assignment, you will create a simple inventory management system which allows users to add, remove, and view items in the inventory.

## Requirements

## Level 1 - Mandatory

1. Create class `Item`, which has name, quantity, and created date, which are private. Amount of each item cannot be negative. Provide the following features:

- Constructor to take parameters of name, quantity, and created date (optional, if not set, it will be current date).

2. Create class `Store` with the following properties and methods:

- A collection to store items, which is private. Initially, this will be an empty collection.
- Methods to add/delete one item to the collection. Do not allow to add items with same name to the store
- Method `GetCurrentVolume` to compute the total amount of items in the store
- Method `FindItemByName` to find an item by name.
- Method `SortByNameAsc`to get the sorted collection by name in ascending order.

```
// items example - You do not need to follow exactly the same
var waterBottle = new Item("Water Bottle", 10, new DateTime(2023, 1, 1));
var chocolateBar = new Item("Chocolate Bar", 15, new DateTime(2023, 2, 1));
var notebook = new Item("Notebook", 5, new DateTime(2023, 3, 1));
var pen = new Item("Pen", 20, new DateTime(2023, 4, 1));
var tissuePack = new Item("Tissue Pack", 30, new DateTime(2023, 5, 1));
var chipsBag = new Item("Chips Bag", 25, new DateTime(2023, 6, 1));
var sodaCan = new Item("Soda Can", 8, new DateTime(2023, 7, 1));
var soap = new Item("Soap", 12, new DateTime(2023, 8, 1));
var shampoo = new Item("Shampoo", 40, new DateTime(2023, 9, 1));
var toothbrush = new Item("Toothbrush", 50, new DateTime(2023, 10, 1));
var coffee = new Item("Coffee", 20);
var sandwich = new Item("Sandwich", 15);
var batteries = new Item("Batteries", 10);
var umbrella = new Item("Umbrella", 5);
var sunscreen = new Item("Sunscreen", 8);
```

## Level 2 - Extra feature: Capacity

Class `Store` should have the following features:

- Maximum capacity , which is total amount of items allowed in the store, and constructor should also take an integer value as the maximum capacity of the inventory.
- Modify the add method to not overload the capacity

## Level 3 - Extra feature: Complex functionalities

Class `Store` should have extra features

- Method `SortByDate` to get the sorted collection by date dynamically (asc or desc)
  ```
   // method invocation example - You do not need to follow exactly the same
  var store = new Store(300)
  // ... add all items to the store
  var collectionSortedByDate = store.SortByDate(SortOrder.DESC)
  // print all items
  ...
  ```
- Method `GroupByDate` to return 2 groups `New Arrival` and `Old` items. `New Arrival` items are those created within the last three months. For example, if the current month is October, then items created in August, September, and October are categorized as `New Arrival`. Items created before August are categorized as `Old`.

  ```
  // method invocation example - You do not need to follow exactly the same
  var store = new Store(300)
  // ... add all items to the store
  var groupByDate = store.GroupByDate();
  foreach (var group in groupByDate) {
      Console.WriteLine($"{group.Key} Items:");
      foreach (var item in group.Value) {
          Console.WriteLine($" - {item.Name}, Created: {item.CreatedDate.ToShortDateString()}");
      }
  }

  //Expected outcome
  New Arrival Items:
   - Coffee, Created: [current date]
   - Sandwich, Created: [current date]
   - Batteries, Created: [current date]
   - Umbrella, Created: [current date]
   - Sunscreen, Created: [current date]

  Old Items:
   - Water Bottle, Created: 01/01/2023
   - Chocolate Bar, Created: 02/01/2023
   - Notebook, Created: 03/01/2023
   - Pen, Created: 04/01/2023
   - Tissue Pack, Created: 05/01/2023
   - Chips Bag, Created: 06/01/2023
   - Soda Can, Created: 07/01/2023
   - Soap, Created: 08/01/2023
   - Shampoo, Created: 09/01/2023
   - Toothbrush, Created: 10/01/2023
  ```
